    "title": "Debugging Go with VS Code",
    "content": "\n\nDebugging is used to detect and fix faults in programs, preventing them from performing incorrectly after being deployed to production. When there are several tightly-connected modules, debugging becomes even more complicated since each change made in one module may cause errors in another.\n\nDevelopers can debug Go applications with the Visual Studio Code editor. With the required debugging extensions, the VS Code editor provides outstanding tools for debugging Go programs.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nTo complete this tutorial, you’ll need the following:\n\n-   Go installed on your system\n-   Basic understanding of the Go programming language\n-   VS Code v1.63 installed on your computer\n-   [Go](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go) and [Delve extensions installed](https://blog.logrocket.com/comparing-go-debugging-tools/#delve) in your VS Code editor\n\n## Creating a sample app\n\nFor a better grasp of how the VS Code debugger works, let’s create a basic Go application that generates a JSON output from an array. To create the new Go program, open your terminal and run the commands below:\n\n```shell\nmkdir go-debugging\ncd go-debugging\ngo mod init github.com/USERNAME/go-debugging\ntouch cmd/go-debugging/main.go\n```\n\nIn the command above, change `USERNAME` to your personal GitHub username. Open the `main.go` file and add the following code using your VS Code editor:\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n   \"encoding/json\"\n   \"fmt\"\n   \"log\"\n)\n\ntype user struct {\n   FullName string `json:\"full_name\"`\n   Email string `json:\"email\"`\n   Gender   string `json:\"gender\"`\n   Status   string `json:\"status\"`\n   RegDate   string `json:\"Reg_date\"`\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n   userinfos := []user{\n       {\n           FullName: \"blessing james\",\n           Email: \"blessing@gmail.com\",\n           Gender:   \"Male\",\n           Status:   \"active\",\n           RegDate:\"20-01-2021\",\n       },\n       {\n           FullName: \"matt john\",\n           Email: \"matt@gmail.com\",\n           Gender:   \"Male\",\n           Status:   \"active\",\n           RegDate:\"20-01-2021\",\n       },\n       {\n           FullName: \"john peace\",\n           Email: \"peace@gmail.com\",\n           Gender:   \"Midgard\",\n           Status:   \"active\",\n           RegDate:\"20-01-2021\",\n       },\n   }\n\n   jsonBytes, err := json.Marshal(userinfos)\n   if err != nil {\n       log.Fatalln(err)\n   }\n   fmt.Println(string(jsonBytes))\n}\n```\n\nThe code above will print the array `userinfos` in JSON format. You can execute the application using the command below:\n\n```shell\ngo run main.go\n```\n\nThe output of the command above is in JSON format, as shown below:\n\n```json\n[{\"full_name\":\"blessing james\",\"email\":\"blessing@gmail.com\",\"gender\":\"Male\",\"status\":\"active\",\"Reg_date\":\"20-01-2021\"},{\"full_name\":\"matt john\",\"email\":\"matt@gmail.com\",\"gender\":\"Male\",\"status\":\"active\",\"Reg_date\":\"20-01-2021\"},{\"full_name\":\"john peace\",\"email\":\"peace@gmail.com\",\"gender\":\"Midgard\",\"status\":\"active\",\"Reg_date\":\"20-01-2021\"}]\n```\n\n## Setting up a debugging session in VS Code\n\nSetting up the debugging configuration in Go is pretty simple and straightforward. From your VS Code’s sidebar menu, click on the **Run and Debug** button, then click on **create a `launch.json` file**:\n\n![Set Up Debugging Sessions VS Code](lang.go.debugging/web2201_set-up-debugging-sessions-vs-code.png)\n\nYou’ll see a dropdown menu where you can select your `workspace folder`. Then, select **Go** for environment language. Finally, select **Launch Package** for debug configuration. This configuration will create the `launch.json` file, which will contain the following code:\n\n```json\n{\n    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.\n    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.\n    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Launch Package\",\n            \"type\": \"go\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"mode\": \"auto\",\n            \"program\": \"${fileDirname}\"\n        } \n    ]\n}\n```\n\nChange the value for `program` in the JSON settings above to the application file name, `main.go` in our case:\n\n```json\n\"program\": \"main.go\"\n```\n\nAfter you save the `launch.json` configuration, the `DEBUG CONSOLE` at the bottom of the editor window will display your project’s output. The debug toolbar will appear at the top of the screen, allowing you to step through the code, pause the script, or end the session.\n\nTo debug the application, click on the **play icon** near `RUN AND DEBUG`, which will display the program output in the `DEBUG CONSOLE` window:\n\n![Debug Console Window Output](lang.go.debugging/web9325_debug-console-window-output.png)\n\nIf you are run delve debugger extension for the first time, you will likely get an error, as shown below:\n\n![VS Code Debugger Error](lang.go.debugging/web1033_vs-code-debugger-error.png)\n\nTo resolve this error, in your terminal enter the command below and click on run and debug icon again:\n\n```bash\nInstall -v githup.com/go-delve/cmd/dlv@latest\n```\n\n## Debugging using a breakpoint\n\nA breakpoint allows you to inspect a line of code by pausing its execution. Breakpoints can be set practically anywhere in VS Code, including variable declarations, expressions, comments, and blank lines, with the exception of function declaration statements.\n\nLet’s add breakpoints to lines `26`, `29`, and `35`. Simply click to the left of the line number, and you’ll see a red dot appear:\n\n![Debbugging Breakpoint](lang.go.debugging/web4179_debugging-breakpoint.png)\n\nWhen you debug the program above, execution will pause at each breakpoint. First, the program will automatically pause on line `26`. By clicking on the **Continue** **button** `F8`from the debug toolbar, the program will resume its execution until the next breakpoint is reached on line `29`, then line `35`.\n\nUnder the **VARIABLES** panel, we can inspect the current scope of each identifier by hovering over the line of the current breakpoint, marked in yellow.\n\n### Using a conditional breakpoint\n\nIn VS Code, you can modify breakpoints by giving them an expression, usually a boolean expression, allowing you to inspect your program whenever certain expressions are `true` or `false`.\n\nFor example, we could add a conditional breakpoint that is raised only when the expression is `true`, as in `user[2].email == \"matt@gmail.com\"`. To do so, right-click on the breakpoint and select **Conditional Breakpoint**:\n\n![Conditional Breakpoint VS Code](lang.go.debugging/web1931_conditional-breakpoint-vscode.png)\n\n### Using the logpoint\n\nInstead of pausing the code execution and breaking into the debugger, the logpoint is a type of breakpoint that logs a message or value to the console, which is important for the debugging workflow.\n\nTo add and remove `log()` statements without changing the code, right-click the gutter and select **Add Logpoint.** In place of the red circle, the logpoint is represented by a red diamond-shaped icon. In the terminal, you’ll see a text input field; to log an expression or variable’s value, put it in curly brackets:\n\n![Add Logpoint Debug Vscode](lang.go.debugging/web8117_add-logpoint-debug-vscode.png)\n\n## Inspecting our code execution\n\nAt the top of the VS Code editor, you’ll see the debug toolbar, which contains directions for effectively navigating the debugger. Let’s review these one by one:\n\n![Debug Toolbar VSCode](lang.go.debugging/web7364_debug-toolbar-vscode.png)\n\n### Continue `F8`\n\nYou can use the continue `F8` button to resume the program’s execution when it pauses at a breakpoint. When debugging your Go program in VS Code, you can add as many breakpoints as you want.\n\n### Step over `F10`\n\nThe step over command `F10` runs the line of code that is currently highlighted before moving on to the next line. You can use the step over command to advance down a function, fully comprehending how it is executed.\n\nIf you use the step over command on a line that calls a function, it will execute the whole function, pausing at the first line underneath the function. \n\n### Step into `F11`\n\nLike the step over command, we can use the step into command to debug a program line-by-line. However, if the step into command encounters a function, the debugger will enter the function that was called, continuing to debug line-by-line from there.\n\n### Step out `Shift+F11`\n\nThe step out command continues the current function’s execution, pausing at the last line. For example, if you mistakenly type a function that has nothing to do with the problem you’re trying to address, you can use the step out command to quickly exit the function and return to the relevant part of your codebase.\n\n### Restart `Ctrl+Shift+F5`\n\nWhenever you wish to restart debugging a program that has hit a breakpoint, you can use the restart command to start debugging the program from the beginning instead of killing and relaunching the debugger.\n\n### Stop `Shift+F5`\n\nOnce you’ve finished debugging your program, use the stop command to exit the debugging session. When you connect to an external Node.js process, a disconnect icon will appear.\n\n## `VARIABLES` panel\n\nNow that we’ve reviewed the functionalities available in the debug toolbar, let’s review the additional tabs in our VS Code editor. In the `VARIABLES` panel, you can see the values of variables and expressions that were evaluated at the breakpoint.\n\nAdditionally, by right-clicking on any of the values in the **context menu**, you can set `Value`, `Copy Value`, or `Add to Watch` for the variable.\n\n## `WATCH` panel\n\nWhen the code is paused, you can bring the values that you want to monitor into view in the `WATCH` panel. Rather than having to go through the `VARIABLES` panel each time you want to check a value, you can add a deeply nested property to the `WATCH` panel for easy access.\n\nThis is especially useful for finding the values of numerous variables at once because they are all immediately recalculated during execution.\n\n## Debugging using unit testing\n\nWe can also use unit testing to debug Go applications; unit testing helps to ensure that each component of the application performs its intended function properly. Let’s look at how we can debug Gol application using unit testing in Visual Studio.\n\nCreate a test file named `main_test.go` and add the following code to the file:\n\n```go\npackage main\nimport \"testing\"\n\nfunc average(score1, score2, score3 int) int {\n    return ((score1 + score2 + score3) / 3)\n}\nfunc Test_arerage(t *testing.T) {\n    score1, score2, score3 := 10, 18, 41\n\n    averageScore := average(score1, score2, score3)\n    if averageScore == 0 {\n        t.Fail()\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nThe two functions above enable us to calculate the average value of three numbers. The function to be tested (`Test_average`) is preceded by the `Test_` keyword. To run the unit test, enter the command below:\n\n```bash\ngo test\n```\n\nNow let’s debug our test file by adding a breakpoint to the program as shown below:\n\n![Golang Debug Unity Test](lang.go.debugging/web7737_golang-debug-unit-test.png)\n\nNow you can start the debugging session, then use the Debug Tool to step over and inspect each variable and change their value under the variables section.\n\n![Golang Unit Testing with the Debug Tool](lang.go.debugging/web6219_Golang-unit-testing-debug-tool.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article, we covered some of the fundamentals for debugging Go applications with Visual Studio Code. The VS Code editor offers helpful plugins that make debugging easy.\n\nWe can add breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, and logpoints to pause our code execution, allowing us to deeply inspect what went wrong. We also explored some of the shortcuts available in the debug toolbar, which allow us to navigate through our code during the debugging process. Lastly, we covered some of the functionalities in the `VARIABLES` panel and the `WATCH` panel.",

    "title": "Hugo Modules Introduction",
    "content": "\n\nWhat are Hugo Modules and should you convert your Hugo site to be one?\n\nThe **Hugo Modules** feature was added to Hugo back in [July 2019](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.56.0). It enables collecting different pieces of your Hugo site source from different repositories, each piece is a _module_. \n\nModules can range from content to themes, providing one or more of the 7 component types defined in Hugo: \n* **static**\n* **content**\n* **layouts**\n* **data**\n* **assets**\n* **i18n**\n* and **archetypes**.\n\nYou can combine modules in any combination you like, and even mount directories from non-Hugo projects, forming a big, virtual union file system.\n\nYou need to install `go` in order to use Hugo Modules.\n\n## What can be a Hugo Module\n\nA Hugo module is a directory which may containe additional subdirectories like layouts, static, data etc. These subdirectories are referred to as *mounts* in Hugo modules.\n\n## Why Use Hugo Modules?\n\nVery basic use case of Hugo Modules is adding themes to the site. We don’t have to use git submodules or copy the theme files. This also enables versioning of the theme and pinning it to specific commit.\n\nSimilarly the files we copy over for shortcodes, static files etc. We just have to add the module and that’s it, Hugo takes care of downloading the files and using them. This simplifies the automated deployment workflows.\n\nWith the ability to use only a specific directory or a file from a module, Hugo modules opens up the door to a lot of possibilities and combinations.\n\n### Separation of reusable components\n\nThis benefit is same as that of using _git submodules_ for managing themes. You might have separate repositories for [adding ATOM feed](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-atom-feed), another for adding [search](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-search-fuse-js) which you would want to reuse on multiple sites, and you integrate those in your main site repo as submodules. Hugo modules allows you to do the same, and then more (recursive module updates, printing dependency graphs, etc.).\n\n### Mounts\n\nOnce a site repo is a Hugo module, it can start using the [**mounts** feature](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/configuration/#module-config-mounts).\n\nLet’s call the main Hugo site repository the *self module*. _Mounts_ are analogous to creating symbolic links very similar to [unionfs](unionfs), it’s kind of like that. From any file or directory in the *self module* to **any** file or directory in one or more of the imported _modules_ (including the [self module](https://scripter.co/hugo-modules-getting-started/#org-radio--self-module)).\n\nAs an example, you might have a `README.md` in the root of your git repository. Using _mounts_, you can tell Hugo to use that same file as if it were `content/_index.md`  as follows\n\n```toml\n[module.mounts](module.mounts)\nsource = \"README.md\"\ntarget = \"content/_index.md\"\n```\n\nNow the same `README.md` serves as the content page for your site’s home page! 🤯\n\n## How to use Hugo Modules?\n\n### Install a recent version of `go`\n\nThe _Hugo Modules_ feature is powered by [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules). So even if you don’t develop anything in `go`, you need to have a recent version of `go` installed.\n\n```bash\nbrew install go\n```\n\n### Convert your Hugo site to a _Hugo Module_\n\nThe first and one time step is to initialize the site as a module. This can be done with `hugo mod init \u003cmodule path\u003e`.\n\n```shell\n# cd /path/to/your/site/repo/\nhugo mod init github.com/USER/PROJECT\n```\n\n\nHere, `github.com/USER/PROJECT` is your Go/Hugo module name. This name does not need to be your git remote repository URL, It can be any globally unique string you can think of.\n\n\u003e Note: The “https://” prefix should not be included in the _[module name](https://scripter.co/hugo-modules-getting-started/#org-radio--module-name)_.\n\nIf all went well, a `go.mod` file will be created that will look like this:\n\n```go\nmodule github.com/USER/PROJECT\n\ngo 1.19\n```\n\nRight now, the `go.mod` only contains your site’s module name and the `go` version used to create it. Once other modules are added as dependencies, they will be added in this same file.\n\n\u003e  `go.mod` file is similar to the `.gitmodules` file when we use _git submodules_.\n\nOnce other module dependencies are added, a `go.sum` file would also be created containing the checksums of all your module dependencies.\n\n\u003e [!Note] Git Submodules\n\u003e \n\u003e If you are managing your Hugo themes via _git submodules_, don’t worry! Converting your site to a Hugo Module will not break anything.\n\n### Hugo Module dependencies\n\nTo add a module as a dependency of a site, we have to run the command `hugo mod get \u003cmodule path\u003e`. Then add an entry for the module in site configuration (in a config.yaml or config.toml file).\n\nThe `\u003cmodule path\u003e` is required to be a valid Go module path like `github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme/v3`. For local modules we don’t have to run the `get` command. We just need to keep them in the `themesDir` (default is `themes`) and add an entry for them.\n\nThe Go module path of the dependencies should resolve to a valid repository. It can be hosted anywhere like GitLab, GitHub etc. It may or may not have a go.mod file in it. _Local Hugo modules don’t need to have a go.mod file if they don’t have any dependencies._\n\nIf your site’s source code is not pushed to a public repository, the Go module path for the site can be a single word as well. _Note that if the module name does not resolve to a repository, it won’t be possible for others to use the site as a dependency._\n\n## Sample Setup\n\nThe following commands, will get a new Hugo site configured, and setup for modules\n\n```bash\ncd ~/Sites\nhugo new site damianflynn\ncd damianflynn\nrm -rf architypes/default.md\n```\n\nWith the base empty site created, we can publish this to GitHub\n```bash\ngit init\ngit add -A :/\ngit commit -m \"feat: new hugo site\"\ngit branch -M main\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/DamianFlynn/hugo.git\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nNow, time to convert the site into a Hugo Module\n\n```bash\nhugo mod init github.com/DamianFlynn/hugo\n```\n\nWith the site now functioning, we can proceed with a look at [posts/sw-ssg-hugo-modules-theme](posts/sw-ssg-hugo-modules-theme).",

    "title": "Theming Hugo with Module",
    "content": "\n\nTo utilize modules in Hugo for our theme, we first must ensure that our site supports [Hugo Modules](posts/sw-ssg-hugo-modules).\n\n\u003e You can quickly verify that you site is configured for Hugo Modules, as it should contain a  `go.mod` file in the repository root.\n\n## Import the `theme` module\n\nThe concept of a Hugo *theme* has been superseded with the concept of *modules*, with the main difference that the former will allow you to build your site entirely, while the latter might implement only some modular features like enabling the ATOM feed, or adding a search to your website.\n\nImporting a module as a theme will typically follow the convention:\n\nUpdate the sites `config.toml` file with the below content, so that it imports the [`hugo-bilberry-theme`](https://github.com/DamianFlynn/hugo-bilberry-theme)  \n    \n```toml\n[module]\n\t[module.imports](module.imports)\n\t\tpath = \"github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme/v3\"\n```\n\nIn this case, the path `github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme/v3` references the Github repo hosting the theme to be used.\n\n\u003e [!Note] Hugo Themes as Modules\n\u003e \n\u003e It’s possible to take any Hugo theme git repo and import that as a Hugo Module even if that repo isn’t actually one i.e. doesn’t have a `go.mod`. But it’s recommended that the theme be a proper Hugo Module so that you have better dependency tracking between your site and the theme.\n\n\n### Testing\n\nCreate `content/testing.md`. This step is optional and is only so that your test site as some content.\n\n```md\n---\ntitle = \"Hello\"\ntype = Article\n---\n# Hey!\n\nWe have a sample article posted\n``` \n\nThat’s it! Now run the Hugo server with the command `hugo server` and look at your site running on localhost.\n\nJust to summerise\n-   Did you need to manually clone any theme? **No**\n-   Would you need to deal with the `.gitmodules` file? **No**\n\n## Tidy up the modules\n\nFinally, run [`hugo mod tidy`](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_mod_tidy/) to clean up the `go.mod` and update or generate the `go.sum` file. These files will track the module dependencies for your site.\n\n-   The `go.mod` contains the direct module dependencies for your site.\n-   The `go.sum` contains the versions and hashes of all the direct **and indirect** dependencies\n  \nJust as you added a theme as a Hugo Module to your site, it’s possible that that theme is depending on other Hugo Modules for your site.\n\n\u003e [!Important] GO Modules\n\u003e \n\u003e You should ensure that both the `go.mod` and `go.sum` are not excluded from your respoitory, for example due to a `.gitignore` inclusion.\n\nCurrently you `go.mod` will be similar to the following:\n\n```go\nmodule github.com/DamianFlynn/hugo\n\ngo 1.19\n\nrequire github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme/v3 v3.14.0 // indirect\n```\n\nwhile, you now also should have a new `go.sum` which again should be similar to this:\n\n```text\ngithub.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme/v3 v3.14.0 h1:4kahS1hSN/txeL2J9MzsEqidz52N0Fltf2iwE2Jmbn0=\ngithub.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme/v3 v3.14.0/go.mod h1:ERTLq/0yIBb0jN0Dh+w5G4wCp9TrB0JY86+Zh+26Dkg=\n```\n\n## Updating the theme \n\nIssing the command will instruct our Hugo module to update all the modules it depends on recursivly.\n\n```bash\nhugo mod get -u ./..\n```\n\nIf you wish to target a specif module only, for example our theme, then we would issue the following command\n\n```shell\nhugo mod get -u github.com/DamianFlynn/hugo\n```\n\nAnd, if you wish to reference a specific tag or commit in [git](git) with the following format\n\n```bash\nhugo mod get \u003cmodule path\u003e@\u003cgit ref\u003e\n```\n\n\u003e [!info] Dependency Graph\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have a theme added as a Hugo Module, which depends on other Hugo Modules, it’s often helpful to know the dependency graph. You can do that by running:\n\u003e ```shell\n\u003e  hugo mod graph\n\u003e ```\n\u003e \n\u003e Which in our current configuration, appears as follows\n\u003e ```text\n\u003e github.com/DamianFlynn/hugo github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme/v3@v3.14.0\n\u003e ```",
