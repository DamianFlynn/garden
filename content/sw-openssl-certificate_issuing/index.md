It is enevitable, that at some point in time, you will need to issue a certificate for your system. There are a couple of relativly simple steps to acheive this, begining with the creation of a certificate request, then submitting this to an online certificate authority, which will process the request and issue you a certificate with both a Public and Private Key.

In this post, we will use the **[OpenSSL](sw-openssl-install_ubuntu)** utility to create such a request file, and walk trough the steps of issuing a certificate from a Windows PKI Server.

## Creating our Certificate Request

We will create a Certificate Request template file which defines the requirements or purpose of the certificate, optional data can be encoded into the certificate, for illustrative purposes. I will include [Subject Alternate Name](Subject Alternate Name) in the issued certificate. 

> [!note] Computer Certificate
> In this article, the certificates we are working with are to be used in validating a computers identity. This is a common requirement when authenticating with WiFi or VPN services within the organisation


The request file we create can be named as you wish, I will be using  `~/san.cnf`

```ini
[ req ]
default_bits = 2048
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions = req_ext
[ req_distinguished_name ]
countryName = Country Name (2 letter code)
stateOrProvinceName = State or Province Name (full name)
localityName = Locality Name (eg, city)
organizationName = Organization Name (eg, company)
commonName = Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name)
[ req_ext ]
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = radius.diginerve.ie
```

The above is a working template - the only changes you should make to this file is the **atl_names** at the bottom, where these  should represent the name of the system you wish to have the certificate issued on behalf of; In my example this is *radius.diginerve.ie*

## Create the Private Key

From the computer you are wishing to create the certificate for (for example a [Linux FreeRadius server](sw-freeradius-getting_started), we will generate the request for private key using the template as follows.

> [!Note] OpenSSL
> OpenSSL will ask some additional questions during execution

The following command parameters instruct [OpenSSL](sw-openssl-install_ubuntu) to generate a certificate request
* `req`: OpenSSL should generate a Certificate Request
* `-newkey rsa:2048`: The Request should be encrypted using **RSA 2048** 
* `-nodes`: 
* `-keyout server.key`: The Private Key should be saved as `server.key`. This file should be protected
* `-out server.csr`: The name of the output file which containes the public shareable, encoded request we will send to the issuing server.
* `-config san.cnf`: The name of the file which we previosuly saved as the [request template](sw-openssl-certificate_issuing#creating-our-certificate-request)

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.csr -config san.cnf


Generating a RSA private key

writing new private key to 'server.pem'
-----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:ie
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Mayo
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Ballina
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:DigiNerve
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:IT
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:radius.diginerve.ie
Email Address []:support@diginerve.ie
```

### Validate the Request File

Before we take the Certificate to the PKI server to issue the certificate for the server, we can double check the request to ensure that the SAN is included as per the Template.

```bash    
openssl x509 -in server.crt -text -noout
```

This command will read in the new certificate request file, and dump its content in a readable text format so we can validate the request is correct.

## Present the Certificate Request to Windows PKI

With our Certificate Request file (`.csr`) now created, we will proceed to submit the request to the PKI Infrastructure which we will be requesting to issue us the certificate. 

### Windows PKI Infrastructure

> [!important] Windows PKI
> This portion of the Article focuses on using a Windows PKI deployed to provide a Private Key Infrastructure within an Organisation to process the request and issue the certificate. 

As this article is focusing on the use of a Private Enterprise Certificate to authenticate a trusted computer access the organisations WiFi or VPN environment, we will concentrate on working with this technology to process and issue a certificate fit for purpose from the organisations infrastructure.

Before we begin, we do need to have a copy of the certicate request we created,  `server.csr` transferred to the system we will be operating on to process the request.

### Check the Windows PKI Server Templates

Despite the fact that we created a template earlier for our certicicate to indicate that we going to concentrate on a *Computer* certificate, the Windows PKI environment premits the System Adminstrators to name the templates which it will issue certificates using to match the [organisations governance](organisations governance) standard.

Therefore, before we present the certificate to the Issuing server to process our request, we should first ask the Issuing Server what are the templates which it is willing to allow us to request, and what name has been associated with the various templates.

> [!warning]
> Windows PKI services follow an [RBAC](RBAC) architecture, in which the templates that are offered will depend on the context of the request, for example its quite common to find that users are not premitted to request machine or computer certificates. These will typically be resticted to a computer or service identity.

Users looking to issue a computer or machine certificate, typically are using the certicicates to protect a web site using HTTPS for transport, therefore, it is common that the only suitable template that we can choose maybe a *web server* or *server* template, from the list offered by the Issuing CA

```powershell
certutil -CATemplates


IPSECIntermediateOffline: IPSec (Offline request) -- Auto-Enroll: Access is denied.
CEPEncryption: CEP Encryption -- Auto-Enroll: Access is denied.
EnrollmentAgentOffline: Exchange Enrollment Agent (Offline request) -- Auto-Enroll: Access is denied.
Administrator: Administrator -- Auto-Enroll: Access is denied.
WebServer: Web Server -- Auto-Enroll: Access is denied.


CertUtil: -CATemplates command completed successfully.
```

### Requesting the Certificate

> [!Important] Certificate Templates
> From the list of offered Certificate templates, we are technially looking tof the template which include's the **Server Authentication** OID. 
> For systems which do not include templates with the **Server Authentication** OID in the available list, refer to the topic [Manually adding the Server Authentication OID](sw-openssl-certificate_issuing#optional---manually-adding-the-oid-to-the-certificate-request)

In this context I will use **'Web Server'** in the request the certificate

```powershell
certreq.exe -attrib "CertificateTemplate:Web Server" server.csr
```

A window will popup asking you to select the [Certificate Authority](Certificate Authority) (CA) where your request is to be submitted to, typically any of the presented servers will work fine, as long as they are approved to issue certificates based on the selected template. If the selected Certificate Authority has a problem with processing the request, try selecting an alternative, or checking within the organisation PKI support team to identify the correct server to utilize.

On a sucessful presentation, the `certreq` tool will present a dialog asking for where to save the new certificate. Provide a filename (for this simple example, Ill just call it `server`) and complete the wizard. 

At this point we now have our issued certificate with ONLY its public key, stored in a file called `server.cer` which we will next need to transfer back to the system we orginally created the request on.

> [!Warning] Public and Private Keys
> The Certificate we just received from the PKI server only contains the Public Key, the matching Private Key (the main secret for decrypting) is stored on the machine we created the request from initially, which in this article was called `server.key`

Copy the public key certificate file, 'server' back to the machine we created the request on, in this case, it was our FreeRadius server.

### Optional - Manually Adding the OID to the Certificate Request

> [!Important] Server Authentication OID
> This following step is only relevant if the issueing server, will not offer a template which includes the property for Server Authentication

When generating certificates for use by **FreeRadius EAP-TLS**, This has two requirements so that the service will successfully validate the certificate.

* Include the "Server Authentication" (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)
* Include a Subject Alternate Name

> **802.1x** 
>
> When a client uses PEAP-EAP-MS-Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) version 2 authentication, PEAP with EAP-TLS authentication, or EAP-TLS authentication, Microsoft specifies that certificates must have the "Enhanced Key Usage" attribute with the value "Server Authentication" (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1). [Ref.: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/814394/en-us ]

If these extension are not present in your FreeRadius certificate, the auth process will fail, because the client will stop communicating with your server due that it can't validate your cert.

Since the certificate request generated in openssl according to the procedure above does not provide this attribute, it is necessary to add it to the pending request with the Windows CLI command `certutil`.

The general syntax is `certutil -setextension RequestID ExtensionOID Flags @InFile`

- The *RequestID* is the sequence ID for our requested certificate from the issueing Certificate Authority
- The *ExtensionOID* for the attribute "Enhanced Key Usage" is **2.5.29.37**
* The *flags* value is set to *0*.
* For the *@InFile*, we will create an input text file `eku.txt` as follows
  ```powershell
  echo 30 0a 06 08 2b 06 01 05  05 07 03 01 > eku.txt
  ```

Now, with all the information required, we can run the following command, Remember to replace `[RequestID]` with the actual numeric request ID

```powershell
certutil -setextension [RequestID] 2.5.29.37 0 @eku.txt
```

Once the command has completed, launch the Windows  Certification Authority application

* Open **Pending request**
	* Right click on the request we just modified (RequestID)
	* Select **All tasks** -->  **Issue**
* Go to **Issued certificates**
	* Locate and double-click on the one you just issued *[RequestID]*.
		* A window will open displaying cert's info. 
		* Go to the tab **Details** and check that the field **Enhanced Key Usage** is present and its value is **Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)**.
		* Click on the button **Copy to file...** and save it as either DER encoded or Base-64 encoded
			* Provide a filename (let's call it `server`) and finish the wizard. 
			* This will give you a file `server.cer`.

Copy the public key certificate file, 'server' back to the machine we created the request on, in this case, it was our FreeRadius server.

## Verify the Servers Certificate

Back on our Linux node, with a copy of our new certificate on hand `server.cer`, we can now check that the certificate matches all the requirements we outlined at the beginning of this process

* Include the Servers **Common name**, eg `radius.diginerve.ie`
* Include the **Server Authentication** (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)
* Include a **Subject Alternate Name**

> [!Note] FreeRadius
> FreeRaidus expects that the public certificates be placed in the folder `/etc/freeradius/certs`

Using OpenSSL can view the certificate

### FreeRadius Compatability

> [!Note] DER Encoded Certificate
> FreeRadius does not work with **DER Encoded Certificates**, these must be instead in **Base64** format to function

If necessary, we may have to convert our certifcate from **DER Encoding** to **Base64 Encoding**. This can be completed using the `openssl` tool with the following syntax:

```bash
openssl x509 -inform DER -in server.cer -outform PEM -out server.pem
```
