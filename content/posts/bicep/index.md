Bicep is a domain-specific language for Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates that simplifies the creation and management of Azure resources. It provides a cleaner syntax, improved modularity, and type safety compared to ARM templates. Bicep can be compiled into ARM templates, making it easy to adopt for existing ARM users, and it integrates with various other tools, such as Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions. Overall, Bicep streamlines the deployment and management of Azure resources, making it a valuable tool for Azure developers and administrators.
