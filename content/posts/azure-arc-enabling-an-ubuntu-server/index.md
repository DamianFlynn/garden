Azure Arc enables you to extend Azure management capabilities to hybrid environments, including on-premises datacenters and third-party cloud providers. You can use Azure Arc to manage and configure your Windows and Linux server machines and Kubernetes clusters that are hosted outside of Azure. You can also use Azure Arc to introduce Azure data services to hybrid environments.

![Image](img-1deeb56e-image-49.png)

Azure Arc-enabled servers lets you manage Windows and Linux physical servers and virtual machines hosted outside of Azure, on your corporate network, or other cloud provider.

![Image](img-1deeb56e-image-30.png)

## Getting started

Starting from an Ubuntu server, which has be Arc Enabled, we can use this as a base for the Azure IoT Operations.

1. Arc Enabled Ubuntu Server
### Edge Hardware

For the initial environment I am running a VM on KVM, with 2 core process and 4Gb of RAM. The operating system I am implementing is Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Server, with SSH enabled for access. I have no additional packages installed at this point. This system will be our new Edge Server. 

### Azure Arc

In the Azure Portal, navigate to **Azure Arc** and expand the **Azure Arc resources** where we will select the node **Machines**. From the View, we can now select the option **Add/Create **to present a drop down list, where we can choose the **Add a machine**

![Image](img-1deeb56e-image.png)

We will select from the presented list of choices the appropriate option, in this scenarion, I am selecting **Add a single server**

![Image](img-1deeb56e-image.png)

The presented Form, permits us to select the Subscription and target resource group which will host the ARC resources, identify the region for the resources, and the operating system we are connecting, Linux in this case. The communication flow from the Edge machine to Azure we will use the Public Endpoint initially.

![Image](img-1deeb56e-image.png)

The next page of the Wizard allows to define tags which we will use to organise the resources, 

![Image](img-1deeb56e-image.png)

And then finally, we are offered the script which we are to run on our edge system.

![Image](img-1deeb56e-image.png)

This is the generated script

```bash
export subscriptionId="df56d048-2e20-4ab6-82b7-11643163aa53";
export resourceGroup="iot-operations";
export tenantId="d993d9e4-644e-4d0a-ba80-0e010d0ea023";
export location="northeurope";
export authType="token";
export correlationId="f7cabe53-552b-4c75-90f7-d021e9f0985a";
export cloud="AzureCloud";


# Download the installation package
LINUX_INSTALL_SCRIPT="/tmp/install_linux_azcmagent.sh"
if [ -f "$LINUX_INSTALL_SCRIPT" ]; then rm -f "$LINUX_INSTALL_SCRIPT"; fi;
output=$(wget https://gbl.his.arc.azure.com/azcmagent-linux -O "$LINUX_INSTALL_SCRIPT" 2>&1);
if [ $? != 0 ]; then wget -qO- --method=PUT --body-data="{\"subscriptionId\":\"$subscriptionId\",\"resourceGroup\":\"$resourceGroup\",\"tenantId\":\"$tenantId\",\"location\":\"$location\",\"correlationId\":\"$correlationId\",\"authType\":\"$authType\",\"operation\":\"onboarding\",\"messageType\":\"DownloadScriptFailed\",\"message\":\"$output\"}" "https://gbl.his.arc.azure.com/log" &> /dev/null || true; fi;
echo "$output";

# Install the hybrid agent
bash "$LINUX_INSTALL_SCRIPT";

# Run connect command
sudo azcmagent connect --resource-group "$resourceGroup" --tenant-id "$tenantId" --location "$location" --subscription-id "$subscriptionId" --cloud "$cloud" --tags 'Datacenter=North Europe,City=Ballina,StateOrDistrict=Mayo,CountryOrRegion=Ireland,environment=MVP,ArcSQLServerExtensionDeployment=Disabled' --correlation-id "$correlationId";

```

I have installed SSH on the Edge node, and will use this method to connect; of course you may choose to connect via console, and type the script above, or use USB type media to provision the script.


### Edge Agent Installation

Working on the Edge device, I simply paste the script in blocks

First we will define the variables which identify our Azure Target settings

```bash
sysadmin@otedge001:~$ 
export subscriptionId="df56d048-2e20-4ab6-82b7-11643163aa53";
export resourceGroup="iot-operations";
export tenantId="d993d9e4-644e-4d0a-ba80-0e010d0ea023";
export location="northeurope";
export authType="token";
export correlationId="f7cabe53-552b-4c75-90f7-d021e9f0985a";
export cloud="AzureCloud";
```


Next we proceed to download from the [**arc.azure.com**](http://arc.aure.com/) domain, the linux agent.


> [!warning] ⚠️ 
> This step requires that the edge system is premitted via the firewalls to communicate with the Microsoft download servers
```bash
sysadmin@otedge001:~$ 
# Download the installation package
LINUX_INSTALL_SCRIPT="/tmp/install_linux_azcmagent.sh"
if [ -f "$LINUX_INSTALL_SCRIPT" ]; then rm -f "$LINUX_INSTALL_SCRIPT"; fi;
output=$(wget https://gbl.his.arc.azure.com/azcmagent-linux -O "$LINUX_INSTALL_SCRIPT" 2>&1);
if [ $? != 0 ]; then wget -qO- --method=PUT --body-data="{\"subscriptionId\":\"$subscriptionId\",\"resourceGroup\":\"$resourceGroup\",\"tenantId\":\"$tenantId\",\"location\":\"$location\",\"correlationId\":\"$correlationId\",\"authType\":\"$authType\",\"operation\":\"onboarding\",\"messageType\":\"DownloadScriptFailed\",\"message\":\"$output\"}" "https://gbl.his.arc.azure.com/log" &> /dev/null || true; fi;
echo "$output";

```

Everything looks good, and the latest **azcmagent **will be installed for us. At this point, we will need to connect this agent to Azure, which will of course require premision via the Firewall, but also we will need to authenticate the request is authorised; so to ensure that only our edge devices are connected to our Azure instances

```bash
sysadmin@otedge001:~$ # Run connect command
sudo azcmagent connect --resource-group "$resourceGroup" --tenant-id "$tenantId" --location "$location" --subscription-id "$subscriptionId" --cloud "$cloud" --tags 'Datacenter=North Europe,City=Ballina,StateOrDistrict=Mayo,CountryOrRegion=Ireland,environment=MVP,ArcSQLServerExtensionDeployment=Disabled' --correlation-id "$correlationId";

INFO    Connecting machine to Azure... This might take a few minutes. 
INFO    Testing connectivity to endpoints that are needed to connect to Azure... This might take a few minutes. 
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code C27DQAPZ2 to authenticate.# Run connect command

```

After the command is exucteded, we are instructed to open our broweser and use the device authentication string to authenticate the connection, this will be followed by the normal authentication MFA flows for your environment, and should conclude with a confirmation that the Authentication is valid

    ![Image](img-1deeb56e-image.png)
    
      ![Image](img-1deeb56e-image.png)
    
    In the meantime, the agent should progress with its tasks

```

On successful completion, if we open the link provided, or just navigate to the machine in the Arc Portal, we will be presented with our new device ready for the next stage


![Image](img-1deeb56e-image.png)

## Managing the Device

Navigating to the Machines page in Azure, we get a first view of the information that has been made available to us, including the Linux Version, the Name of the system, and even the hardware manufacturer *(which in this scenario is QEMU, my virtualization platform). *We also should see all the tags we defined in the script are applied 

![Image](img-1deeb56e-image.png)

### Connect with SSH

While I enabled SSH on the machine, with the purpose of running the script for installation, this SSH connection is NOT enabled outside the local network, and for good reason my IT Security policy would not have this exposed on the firewall; therefore we are confined to using this SSH connection when on a local or trusted routed network. This is not going to be the case for the vast majority of use cases, putting these edge nodes into networks which maybe isolated in different manners. 

As the edge machine creates a Web-Socket back to Azure, this traffic is bi-directional, and allows for many different use cases, including opening an SSH connection over the tunnel.

In the Azure Portal if we expand the **Settings **node, and select **Connect** we will see an option to **Connect with SSH **to the device, offering different authentication options, and the choice of working from the browser or my terminal via an AZ Cli command

```bash
# Azure CLI command to SSH via ARC
az ssh arc --subscription "df56d048-2e20-4ab6-82b7-11643163aa53" --resource-group "iot-operations" --name "otedge001" --local-user "sysadmin"
```


> [!tip] 💡 
> This solution is based on the Azure Relay service, a hidden gem in Azure because it can create secure tunnels all over the internet and beyond. This is also the magic used to support the communication for all other extensions (like Azure IoT Operations).
  Check out the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/servers/ssh-arc-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5002324) for more details about the SSH connection. There is also a [troubleshooting guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/servers/ssh-arc-troubleshoot?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5002324).
  
  > 📢 To  authenticate with Microsoft Entra you will need to make sure you have the 'Microsoft Entra based SSH Login - Azure Arc' extension installed on this server, and the role of ‘Virtual machine administrator login’ or ‘Virtual machine user login’ assigned. 
  ### Browser Cloud Shell

As my test node just has basic **Password **authentication currently, lets try this with the in browser experience

 

![Image](img-1deeb56e-image.png)

The option to connect using the browser is enabled by the use of **Azure Cloud Shell **which will be launched for us, and then the command automatically pasted and executed on our behalf. 


> [!tip] 💡 
> As my environment did not have an exisiting Azure Cloud Shell configuration, for this scenario I did not choose to have presistent storage, and used the same subscription for the Cloud Shell resources. Finally I choose to use bash as my shell for personal preference. 
The command returned quickly to inform me that SSH was not enabled 

![Image](img-1deeb56e-image.png)


I chose to stick with the default port TCP 22, and selected for the agent to update the policy and allow my connect. 

```bash
damian [ ~ ]$ az ssh arc --subscription df56d048-2e20-4ab6-82b7-11643163aa53 --resource-group iot-operations --name otedge001 --local-user sysadmin

The script then continued, attempting to build the SSH Connection, but failed suggesting that it may need a little more time

After waiting about 2 minutes, I re-ran the command, and was instantly greeted with my SSH authentication Challenge

And just like that, I was challenged for my password, and then authenticated. From the last line I can also see that my previous connection which was used to install the ARC Agent initially was from an IP address on the same Local Network as my edge node. 

### Terminal Shell

On my Mac, which is not on the same network as the Edge node, I will try the same connection exercise, I have the AZ Cli installed, but have not used the ARC extensions previously. 

AZ identified that the extension was missing, and proceed to install it. Then quickly continued to establish the SSH Connection via Azure as the proxy.

I needed again to supply my local password for the edge node, and was then connected.

Notice that the Last login, which represents the Cloud Shell connection we just completed was presented as 127.0.0.1 which confirms that the Agent on the edge device is relaying our SSH tunnel over the Web Socket and Proxing via Azure. Extremely neat.

## Update Settings

You can use Update Management in Azure Automation to manage operating system updates for your Windows and Linux virtual machines in Azure, physical or VMs in on-premises environments, and in other cloud environments. You can quickly assess the status of available updates and manage the process of installing required updates for your machines reporting to Update Management.

In the portal, we simply enable the **periodic assessment** for updates

![Image](img-1deeb56e-image.png)

After a few moments, the system will be checked for possible updates, which we can also manually check from the portal by navigating to the **Updates **pane in the **Operations** section of the portal. Once the page is open, we can click on the option **Check for updates **which will ask for a confirmation to trigger the check, and then once approved start the process.
