**… And a friendly, voice-controlled interface provides you with all the answers. This scenario isn’t just a thing of the future anymore but may be approaching reality thanks to the “Voice First” concept.**

## The Inspiration: Microsoft’s Guidepost

Watching the Microsoft Copilot event in September 2023 - checking off the ‘Watch-later’ list on vacation 🙂 - it became clear to me: Speech could soon be the primary medium of our digital interactions. The first 15 minutes of the event made it evident how Copilot is already changing our business applications.

## What Does “Voice First” Mean?

“Voice First” refers to prioritizing speech as the main user interface. Just as “Mobile First” emphasized mobile devices, “Voice First” relies on the immediacy and naturalness of the human voice. Imagine not having to fill out a child benefit form but simply talking to a digital assistant about it. This way, a complex document could be replaced by a simple voice dialogue that not only asks for information but also provides guidance.

    ## The Bridge: Chat Interfaces as an Intermediate Step
    
      ![Image](img-2e2eb56e-illustration-good-morning-voice-first_hu933f9d204d1eafc26e29eac2706cc57d_499777_288x0_resize_q55_h1_lanczos_3.webp)
    
    Let’s consider chat interfaces as a transition. They are the first step towards a world where full voice interaction is possible. A purely voice-controlled User Interface (UI) is a fascinating thought, isn’t it? It would fundamentally change the way we interact with technology.

> Instead of typing away, we will soon let our voice do the talking – ‘Voice First’ is not just a trend, it is tomorrow’s communication.

## Speculations and Possibilities

The launch of MS Copilot - which has been usable for a few days now - in business applications might only be the start of a “Voice First” era. Think about it: How would your daily work change if you could talk to your computer instead of typing and clicking? The boosts in efficiency and the reduction of accessibility issues are just a few of the benefits that could be ahead.

* Imagine a world where your words take command – ‘Voice First’ enables seamless and efficient communication with technology without ever having to lift a finger.
* ‘Voice First’ creates a more personal relationship with technology – your device becomes more of a partner than a tool, understanding your instructions and responding like a good friend.
* The ‘Voice First’ movement could radically transform everyday business life – concepts like talking to your computer could enhance productivity while also improving accessibility.
## Your Opinions Are Wanted!

Now it’s your turn. What are your thoughts on “Voice First”? Could the integration of Copilot into our systems be the catalyst for this revolution? Share your thoughts in the comments. It’s incredibly exciting to hear different perspectives on this development. Your insights enrich the discussion and help us shape the future of human-machine interaction.
