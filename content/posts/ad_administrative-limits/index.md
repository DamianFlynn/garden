I recently ran into an issue with a particular environment where Active Directory and PKI services were deployed. One of the service accounts which I was attempting to 'unlock' refused to co-operate and instead offered the most unhelpful message.
 
**Administrative limit for this request was exceeded** - this was not my first time encountering the message, previously this haunted me while I was managing a Windows PKI infrastructure and with some quick searches, confirmed my initial suspicion. This is a symptom of an AD object quite simply being to large!
 
Active Directory is in the simplest form a Database, and each object can be considered as a row in this database. Like any database there are limits to what data can be stored in the table, the type of data, but also the amount. 
 
Using a tool like **ADSI Edit** will allow you to open the database, and select the schema partition we would like to work with. Standard objects which we can see in the *Active Directory Users and Computers* extension are all hosted in the partition called the *Default Naming Context*; which is where we need to focus for this problem

## Identifying the Bloat

There is no super cool trick here, we just need a little investigation. Start by navigating the OU structure you are familiar with in Active Directory Users and Computers, to locate the account with issues.

![AD Object Navigation in ADSI Edit](ad_administrative-limits/opps-missing-image.png)

Right Click on the object, and select **Properties** where you now get to view the 100's of columns of data which AD stores for each object. 

Click on the **Filter** button and enable the option *Show only attributes that have values* - this will remove all the columns which are empty - and therefore not adding to our overside object!

Now, you can check each of the remaining attributes (columns) and see what they contain, I'll save a few minutes, and in this case I expect my issue is to do with Certificates, so we will focus on the attribute called *userCertificate* which contains an collection of *[byte[]]*, each representing a Base64 encoded Certificate.

BINGO! looking at this property I can see 100's of entries, and each one has the same *byte[]* string, which implies the same certificate is loaded into the object a lot of times.

I am going to flush the lot of them out, as these are added by the system, and it will reload them as required; but for now, I am simply the garbage collector.

Using the UX, we can delete these 1 at a time, so we need a little automation, or the rest of the week will be wasted.

## Powershell Helper

Using standard Active Directory module for Powershell, we can get a reference to the object which needs to be flushed

```powershell
$certUser = Get-Aduser "svc_PKI_NDES" -Properties certificates
```

Now, let's check what we got from AD

```powershell
$certuser.Certificates.Count
1169
```

Right, time to fix this, we will use the following command to remove all the certificates from the object

```powershell
PS C:\Users\sysadmin.AD> set-ADUser svc_PKI_NDES -Certificates @{}
```

And, let's confirm it worked
```powershell
$certuser = Get-ADUser svc_PKI_NDES -Properties Certificates
$certuser.Certificates.count
0
```

And now, just check that you can unlock the account, or complete the operation that sent you chasing this wild goose!
