# What personal data we collect

We are not interested on any personal data. However, we collect for services like statistics and comments to improve the overall user experience. We are not interested in selling your data to any third party company. You can find more information about data collection in the following text.

### Comments

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: [https://automattic.com/privacy/](https://automattic.com/privacy/). After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

We collect information about visitors who comment on Sites that use our Akismet anti-spam service. The information we collect depends on how the User sets up Akismet for the Site, but typically includes the commenter’s IP address, user agent, referrer, and Site URL (along with other information directly provided by the commenter such as their name, username, email address, and the comment itself).

### Media

If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

### Contact forms

We have a couple of forms on our page so you are able to contact us. If you use one of the forms on our page we will use the data provided to answer your question or take your feedback. After your request is handled, we archive the contact request in our messaging system so we can refer later to this conversation. However, we will not use your information to send you any information you haven’t requested and we do not share this information with third parties.

### Cookies

If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.

When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.

If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.

### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

### Analytics

Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (”Google“). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer to help the website analyze how visitors use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.

To have a better understanding how we can improve our website and our content, we are using Google Analytics. We only use Google Analytics to create anonymous statistics. You can find more information about the Privacy Policy of Google here: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

### Facebook Social Plugins

Our website uses facebook.com social plug-ins, which are created and operated by the social network Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). The plug-ins show the Facebook logo. When you open a page on our website containing a social plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection to the servers operated by Facebook. The content of the plug-in is transferred from Facebook directly to your browser and integrated into the web page. Through integration of the plug-in, Facebook receives information that you have accessed the corresponding page on our website. If you are logged into Facebook, Facebook can associate the visit with your Facebook account. If you interact with plug-ins by using the “Like” button or submitting comments, for example, the information is sent from your browser directly to Facebook and stored there.

The data privacy policies of Facebook – [https://www.facebook.com/policy.php](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php) – provide information on the purpose, scope and further processing of Facebook’s data collection practices and its privacy protection settings. If you do not want Facebook to collect data about you through our website, you must log out of your Facebook account before visiting our site.

### Who we share your data with

We do not sell data to any third party vendor. However we are using third party services for our hosting services, statistics and others. These services do have some own statistics and tools. These services include vendors like:

* Hostpoint AG (Privacy Policy)
* Google (Privacy Policy)
* Twitter (Privacy Policy)
* Facebook (Privacy Policy)
* Jetpack (Privacy Policy)
### How long we retain your data

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

### What rights you have over your data

If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

### Where we send your data

Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.

### Your contact information

For the contact information check [https://www.damianflynn.com/contact](https://www.damianflynn.com/contact)

# Additional information

### How we protect your data
